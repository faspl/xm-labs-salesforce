# SalesForce Service
Transform customer relationships, and your business, using the latest in mobile and data technology to deliver the most personalized customer experience ever â€” every time, and anywhere. This document instructs how to setup an integration between xMatters and SalesForce Case Management.  When a case is created, SalesForce reaches into xMatters to figure out who is on call for assignment of the case.

# Pre-Requisites
* SalesForce Case Module
* xMatters account - If you don't have one, [get one](https://www.xmatters.com)!

# Files
* [xMattersAlert.tgr](xMattersAlert.tgr.js) - The trigger used after a Case is initially submitted.  It sets the tokens/fields of the case that will be passed into xMatters and calls the xMatters request function.
* [xMattersreq.cls](xMattersreq.cls) - This is the Apex class that executes the Restful Post call into xMatters.
* [SalesForce.zip](SalesForce.zip) - The comm plan (if needed) that has all the cool scripts and email format and such. 

# How it works
When a new SalesForce Case is submitted, SalesForce pushes the information into xMatters.  xMatters kicks off an event and sends the SalesForce case information to the engineer on call.  That engineer has the ability to respond in the xMatters notification.  By accepting the assignment in the xMatters notification, this updates the SalesForce Assignment field.

# Installation

## Application ABC set up
1. Log into Salesforce as a Salesforce Administrator, Create a new 'Connected App' for OAuth. (Learn more about setting up your Connected App [HERE](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=connected_app_create.htm&type=0)).

2. Using the SFDC Developer Console, Create Apex Trigger to reach out to xMatters. You can use this code to build the message that will be sent to xMatters.  *NOTE: String Endpoint will need to be changed to the Integration URL of your Inbound Configuration in the xMatters Integration Builder:

```
trigger xMattersAlert on Case (after insert) {
String endpoint = 'https://[xmatters instance]/api/integration/1/functions/19c22b53-b1e0-46e7-94ed-8c8d0ad704d2/triggers';
String caseid = '"Case ID":' + '"' + Trigger.New[0].CaseNumber + '"';
string description = '"Description":' + '"' + Trigger.New[0].Description + '"';
string priority = '"Priority":' + '"' + Trigger.New[0].Priority + '"';
string status = '"Status":' + '"' + Trigger.New[0].Status + '"';
string accountid = Trigger.New[0].AccountID;
string accountidj = '"Account ID":' + '"' + Trigger.New[0].AccountID + '"';
string recordid = '"ID":' + '"' + Trigger.New[0].Id + '"';

Account record = [Select Name From Account Where Id = :accountid];

string accountname = '"Account Name":' + '"' + record.Name + '"';
String payload = '{' + recordid + ',' + caseid + ',' + description + ',' + priority + ',' + accountname + ',' + accountidj + ',' + status + '}';
System.debug(accountid);
System.Debug(payload);

xmattersreq.xRESTCall(endpoint, payload);

}
```
3. In the Salesforce Developer Console, Create an Apex Class for your xMatters Request

```
global class xMattersreq {
@future(callout=true)
WebService static void xRESTCall(String endpoint, String payload){
HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
req.setEndpoint(endpoint);
req.setMethod('POST');

req.setBody(payload);
req.setHeader( 'Content-Type', 'application/json' );

Http http = new Http();
HTTPResponse res = http.send(req);
System.debug(' Response: ' + res.getBody());
}
}
```
 

## xMatters set up
1. Import the Salesforce Communication Plan (See Salesforce.zip in files above).

2. In Integration Builder, Configure your Salesforce Endpoint  *NOTE: if you're using a relaxed IP policy, you'll need to add your API token to the end of your Password. 
* At the top navigation bar go to your name > Setup > Personal Setup > My Personal Information > Reset My Security Token.
If your password is mypassword, and your security token is XXXXXXXXXX, then you must enter mypasswordXXXXXXXXXX to log in
Client ID & Client Secret can be found by accessing the connected App in Salesforce.  Setup > 'Quick Find / Search..' box (left side of the screen) > Create > Apps > Find 'Connected Apps' and click on the app (this is the connected app we setup earlier, recommended name is xMatters).  Find Consumer Key (Client ID) and Click to reveal Consumer Secret (Client Secret).

3. Add Recipients/Groups to the xMatters New Case Layout: In this version, you'll need to add the recipients to the layout in the xMatters form.
   
# Testing
Be specific. What should happen to make sure this code works? What would a user expect to see?

# Troubleshooting
Optional section for how to troubleshoot. Especially anything in the source application that an xMatters developer might not know about.
